            <h1>Founder Of Pakistan</h1>
            <p>
              The founder of <b>Pakistan</b>,<b>
                Muhammad Ali Jinnah(1876–1948),</b
              >
              played a pivotal role in establishing the nation as an independent
              state for Muslims in 1947. A lawyer and politician by profession,
              Jinnah led the Indian National Congress initially but later became
              the leader of the All-India Muslim League. His vision for Pakistan
              was deeply rooted in the belief that Muslims in the Indian
              subcontinent needed a separate nation to preserve their identity
              and rights. Known as "Quaid-e-Azam" or "Great Leader," Jinnah’s
              relentless advocacy led to the creation of Pakistan, marking the
              end of British colonial rule in India. His leadership, diplomacy,
              and determination are celebrated annually on Pakistan's
              Independence Day, August 14.
